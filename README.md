## Docker Installation

This task involves installing Docker on your system. Docker is a popular platform that allows you to automate the deployment and management of applications using containerization. By using Docker, you can package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container, which can be easily deployed on any system that has Docker installed.

To install Docker, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Docker website at [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/) and download the appropriate version of Docker for your operating system.

2. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Docker.

3. After the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the following command:

   ```
   docker --version
   ```

   If Docker is installed properly, you should see the version number displayed in the output.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Docker on your system. You are now ready to start using Docker to build, ship, and run your applications in containers.
